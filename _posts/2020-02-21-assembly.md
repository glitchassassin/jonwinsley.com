I sift through a lot of articles on a (more or less) weekly basis to find new and interesting technologies or methodologies. Here are some of the highlights.

1. [Octomments](https://ocs.now.sh/) is a clever way to leverage GitHub issues as embedded comment threads (for a statically-generated blog, for example). It's a work in progress, but something to consider for GitHub Pages hosted sites.
2. [The Web We Want](https://webwewant.fyi/) "is a collective effort by browser makers to understand where the dev community would like us to invest our energy." A good place to understand the pain points facing developers today, and perhaps share some of your own.
3. [Angular 9](https://blog.angular.io/version-9-of-angular-now-available-project-ivy-has-arrived-23c97b63cfa3) is here! Fixes some complaints I've had with Angular's TestBed (goodbye, [ng-bullet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-bullet), you've been a good friend).
4. [Build-specific URLs](https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#testing-the-jamstack) are one of the great ideas from Guillermo Rauch's 2019 in Review that I'm cheerleading in our build process. (There are more - check out the whole list.)
5. [Wry Rules for Navigating a Flawed Universe](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/wry-rules-for-navigating-a-flawed-universe/). Software engineering is about more than writing code. The proverb is an elemental form of wisdom, and these are some good nuggets.
6. [A Complete Guide to Links and Buttons](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-links-and-buttons/). A really thorough exploration, good for inspiration or reference. If you aren't following CSS-Tricks already, add the blog to your feed reader!
