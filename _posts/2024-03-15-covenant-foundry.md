This blog was pretty quiet last year. Outside of work, I had a mostly non-technical focus: studying [biblical counseling](https://biblicalcounseling.com/) and buying a small farm in May (it's a lifestyle, not a career). I did keep refining my [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) codebase, but without any groundbreaking achievements worth writing about.

As the year wrapped up, I started thinking about what would come next, both for 2024 and for the next phase of my career. Though I enjoyed studying counseling and plan to integrate it into my service as a deacon in my local church, I have no desire to switch to full-time ministry. And farming, of course, would not pay (at least not without a parallel income stream from becoming a homestead influencer with a YouTube channel).

I could lean into my individual contributor role as a developer, but it would be very difficult to scale my income significantly without switching companies and sacrificing the things I value about working at [JBS](https://www.jbs.dev/) - flexibility, remote work, a developer-centric culture.

The option with the highest growth ceiling, I decided, would be launching a startup.

There's a *lot* that goes into a successful startup, and most of it isn't dev skills. Leadership, marketing, sales, business organization, market research and validation... as with any small business, when you first start out, *you* are wearing all the hats. So in 2024, I'm attacking that learning curve.

I have a growing shelf of books, including: 

- [Million Dollar Weekend](https://appsumo.com/products/million-dollar-weekend-ga/) by Noah Kagan
- [Never Eat Alone](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Expanded-Updated/dp/0385346654/) by Keith Ferrazzi
- [The Partnership Charter](https://www.amazon.com/Partnership-Charter-Start-Right-Business/dp/0738208981/) by David Gage
- [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/) by Eric Ries

But books are no substitute for experience (as these books will tell you). So, I am also experimenting with launching startups.

First, I'm **partnering with a friend as technical co-founder of his startup [Jobfolio](https://www.jobfolioapp.com/)**, a simple and easy-to-use job management platform for the trades. We're splitting responsibilities, so he is handling the marketing & business side while I build out the technical side. This is nights-and-weekends work for both of us as we try to bootstrap Jobfolio with minimal costs.

Once Jobfolio is profitable and stable, I plan to branch out and continue building and bootstrapping startups following a [venture studio model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_studio). To make this work effectively, we'll need to make the "idea -> validation -> go/no go" cycle as short and cheap as possible. Most ideas *won't* pan out, so we want to test and burn through them as quickly as possible to find the gems. So, I'm going to **practice cheap and fast validation techniques** - sharpening those skills, even though I'm not *yet* ready to start something new.

Finally, I'm **building a network of Christian friends** who are also interested in running their own businesses. My personal focus is tech, but some are working to get *out* of tech and pursue a different dream. We're building alongside each other at [Covenant Foundry](https://covenantfoundry.com/), sharing ideas, resources, and enthusiasm. If you're a Christian entrepreneur (or wantrepreneur), you're welcome to join us!
