I sift through a lot of articles on a weekly basis to find new and interesting technologies or methodologies. Here are some of the highlights.

1. [Octomments](https://ocs.now.sh/) is a clever way to leverage GitHub issues as embedded comment threads (for a statically-generated blog, for example). It's a work in progress, but something to consider for GitHub.io hosted sites.
2. [The Web We Want](https://webwewant.fyi/) "is a collective effort by browser makers to understand where the dev community would like us to invest our energy." A good place to understand the pain points facing developers today, and perhaps share some of your own.
3. [Angular 9](https://blog.angular.io/version-9-of-angular-now-available-project-ivy-has-arrived-23c97b63cfa3) is here! Fixes some complaints I've had with Angular's TestBed (goodbye, [ng-bullet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-bullet), you've been a good friend).
