I recently read "The Glass Cage: How Our Computers Are Changing Us" by Nicholas Carr. The author challenges the naive view that all automation is ultimately good by showing that automation, like any other tool, actually changes the nature of our work - and not always for the better. As an example, airliners have become highly automated, such that pilots have little flying to do except in an emergency situation - but this means their flight skills deteriorate with disuse, and when an emergency does arise, the response is more likely to be panic and incompetence. And, of course, the Industrial Revolution's transformation of skilled craftsmanship to monotonous push-button machine operation has had a profound impact on our culture.

The phenomenon of ChatGPT and other conversations around a societal [decay of competence](https://acmp.substack.com/p/the-decay-of-competence-in-america) have prompted me to begin thinking more deliberately about how automation *ought* to be used.

# Automation for Humans

The first principle is a theological one: *humans were designed for work.*
