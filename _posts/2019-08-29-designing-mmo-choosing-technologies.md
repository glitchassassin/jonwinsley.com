Whenever you start a software design project, the first question to ask is "What are the requirements?" Who is going to be running this software, on what kind of platforms? What kind of functionality does it need to have?

You won't know all the answers up front, and that's okay. We'll be coming up with new requirements until we ship the game (and even after). So let's look at the requirements that lay out the broad shape of our game.
